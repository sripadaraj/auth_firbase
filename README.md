implement email/password authentication using Firebase in a web application

## GitHub Integration:
To connect Firebase Authentication to GitHub, you can implement GitHub authentication using Firebase's authentication providers. This typically involves creating a GitHub application in your GitHub account, obtaining a GitHub OAuth client ID and secret, and configuring the Firebase Authentication settings accordingly.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and there are many aspects to consider for security and best practices. Be sure to refer to the official Firebase Authentication documentation and GitHub API documentation for detailed steps and guidelines:

## Firebase Authentication: ` https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth ` 
GitHub OAuth Apps: https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app
Remember to handle user data and credentials securely and to test thoroughly in development before deploying any code to production.

### 1.HTML:
` Create a simple HTML form to collect user's email and password:`

### 2.firebase-config.js:
` Create a firebase-config.js file to store your Firebase configuration: `

### 3.auth.js:
 ` Create an auth.js file to handle authentication logic:` 


# In this example:
```
The HTML form collects the user's email and password.
The firebase-config.js file initializes Firebase with your project's configuration.
The auth.js file handles the form submission and uses the signInWithEmailAndPassword method to authenticate the user.
Replace the placeholders in the firebase-config.js file with your actual Firebase project details.

```
